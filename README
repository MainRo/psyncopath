psyncopath is a helper for rsync:
- push or pull a mirrored directory.
- add mirrored directory configuration in a user config file.

1- Config file

Create a ~/.psyncopath config file containing the configuration. The
configuration is a python script containing a "config" dictionary.  The
following example declares a "mymirror" workspace:

config['mymirror'] = { 'local_path':'your local path', 'remote_path':'the server/remote path', 'server':'user@host'}

config settings:
- local_path   :  Local directory to mirror.
- remote_path  :  Location where mirroring is done (On the server if a server
                  address is provided).
- server :        user and hostname of a remote server where mirroring is done.
- mode   :        "smb" if mirroring is done on a samba mount point.
- temp_dir     :  local path where temporary files are created. Use this if not
                  supported on remote location.

2- server setup

Ensure that the server has the ssh key of the client available. Password based
authentication is not supported.

Mirroring can be done localy if no server is provided.

3- synchronize

To push a local repository to the server:
psyncopath mymirror push

pull a server mirrored content to a local repository:
psyncopath mymirror pull

where "mymirror" is the name of the workspace
