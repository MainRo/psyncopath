psyncopath is a helper for rsync:
- push or pull a mirrored directory.
- add mirrored directory configuration in a user config file.

Usage: 
1- Config file
Create a ~/.psyncopath config file containing the configuration. The
configuration is a python script containing a "config" dictionary.  The
following example declares a "mymirror" workspace:

config['mymirror'] = { 'local_path':'your local path', 'remote_path':'the server/remote path', 'server':'user@host'}

2- server setup
Ensure that the server has the ssh key of the client available. Password based
authentication is not supported.

3- synchronize

To push a local repository to the server:
psyncopath mymirror push

pull a server mirrored content to a local repository:
psyncopath mymirror pull

where "mymirror" is the name of the workspace
